# yurt-app-manager-api

Schema of the API types that are served by yurt-app-manager.

## Purpose
This library is the canonical location of the yurt-app-manager API definition.

We recommend using the go types in this repo. You may serialize them directly to JSON.

## Where does it come from?
yurt-app-manager-api is synced from https://github.com/openyurtio/yurt-app-manager/tree/master/pkg/yurtappmanager/apis. Code changes are made in that location, merged into openyurtio/yurt-app-manager and later synced here.
